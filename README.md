Having said that, this is What you can do:
1. Find out how many hours you need to sleep - your sleep time
2. What time do you need to wake up? - your rise time
3. Calculate backward from your rise time - to get your bedtime
 
For example:
Your sleep time: 7 hours
Your rise time: 7 a.m.
Your bedtime should be 12 a.m.
BUT wait...
You have to add in about 30 minutes into your bedtime, that is to allow your body to slowly drift off to sleep. I am not sure about how long you take to fall asleep. If it is longer, say 1 hour, then your bedtime (you have to go to bed) will be 11 p.m.
 
Recap:

    Bedtime 11 p.m.
    (1 hour to drift off to zzz)
    Rise Time 7 a.m.
    Sleep time 7 hours
